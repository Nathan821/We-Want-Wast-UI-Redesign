# REMWaste Skip Selection Redesign â€“ React Coding Challenge

![Figma Design Preview](./public/main.png)

This is my submission for the We Want Waste front-end coding challenge.  
I redesigned the "Choose Your Skip Size" page using Figma, then implemented it with a modern, responsive, and animated user interface using **React + Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Framer Motion**.

> Please note: The final coded version may slightly differ from the original Figma design, as I made some necessary adjustments during development.
